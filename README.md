#PLAYLIST

###Created by Linda Gibson for Epicodus Ruby Object Oriented Assessment

###Everyone has an Ipod, MP3, or a phone with music stored in it.  This program helps a person to organize the songs and artists in their playlists.  It allows them to add artists and songs, list all the artists, list all the songs, and even list an artist with all their songs.

This is a very simplified program for an assessment so it does not have extensive features.
